# Be concise
1. Do not make any try catch/except until you asked about it
2. Any import should place at the top of file
3. Do not print any logs until you asked about it
4. Do not write verbose comments until you asked about it, most comments should be short
5. Write type hints for all functions (JSDoc or Python typing)
6. Prefer array methods (map, filter) over loops when possible

# Code style
## Empty line between code blocs
1. When "if", "for", "return" is not the first line in code block then should place empty line before it

# Classes
1. Most of code logic should be writen in classes.
2. If non-static class methods returns void and it can be replaced on return itself then do it.
