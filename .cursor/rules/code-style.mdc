# Be concise
1. Wirte any debug info in english
2. Do not make any try catch/except until you asked about it
3. Any import should place at the top of file
4. Do not print any logs until you asked about it
5. Write type hints for all functions (JSDoc or Python typing)
6. Prefer array methods (map, filter) over loops when possible

## Comments
1. Write any comments in english
2. Do not write verbose comments until you asked about it, most comments should be short
3. Comment blocks. You can use comment blocks for describe multiline in two cases: single commands code or Multiple related blocks. Main target of code blocks: split long function logic on several understandable steps
Example:
```js
//[start] multiline single commands
let a = 1
let b = 2

a = a + b
b = a - b
a = a - b
//[end]

//[start] Multiple related blocks
if (a) {
    console.log(a)
}

if (b) {
    console.log(b)
}
//[end]
```

# Code style
## Empty line between code blocs
1. When "if", "for", "return" is not the first line in code block then should place empty line before and after it. Example
```python
#[start] BAD
arr = []
for i in 5:
    if i < len(arr):
        arr.append(i)
arr.append(0)
#[end]

#[start] GOOD
arr = []

for i in 5:
    if i < len(arr):
        arr.append(i)

arr.append(0)
#[end]
```
2. In objects, dictionaries, etc definitions avery key on new line. Example:
```js
// GOOD this is a short definition
const o = {x: 1, y: 2}
// NORMAL
const o = {lemma: 1, stemma: 2}
```

# Classes
1. Most of code logic should be writen in classes.
2. If non-static class methods returns void and it can be replaced on return itself then do it.
